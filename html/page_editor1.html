                <h3>Splash Screen</h3>
                <p>[I have created a splash screen page for the WellnessWave Shop, featuring a hero section with a captivating background overlay. The page includes a title, a brief message about the mission and values of WellnessWave, and a list of group members involved in the project. The CSS styling enhances the visual appeal with proper layout and alignment. Additionally, I've implemented a JavaScript function to automatically redirect users to the home page after a set duration, providing a seamless transition from the splash screen to the main content.]</p>

                <p>[I led the creation of WellnessWave's shopping platform, employing HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for dynamic functionalities like cart management and payment processing. From organizing content to enhancing visual appeal, each language played a crucial role. With intuitive navigation and seamless social integration, WellnessWave offers an inviting space for users to explore holistic wellness products and embark on their wellness journey]</p>

                <p>[In crafting this content page, I focused on making it easy to understand and engaging for everyone. I organized each section to cover important topics like healthy eating, exercise, stress relief, and good sleep habits. By using clear images and simple language, I aimed to help visitors learn and get inspired. I paid close attention to how everything looks and fits together to make sure it's inviting and easy to follow. Ultimately, my goal was to create a helpful resource that anyone can use to improve their health and wellbeing.]</p>
